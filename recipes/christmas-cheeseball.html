            <li>1 cup <strong>shredded sharp cheddar cheese</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 cup <strong>shredded Monterey Jack cheese</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>chopped fresh parsley</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>garlic powder</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>onion powder</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon  <a href="italian-seasoning.html"><strong>Italian seasoning</strong></a></li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>ground black pepper</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>To Decorate</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons <strong>chopped fresh parsley</strong></li>
            <li>1/4 of each diced <strong>yellow and red bell peppers</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon roughly chopped <strong>pistachios</strong> <em>(Optional)</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>pine nuts</strong> <em>(Optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together the cheeses, then add in the parsley and seasonings
                and beat until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the mixture onto plastic wrap, tightly cover and shape into a cone. Refrigerate for at least
                2-3 hours, and preferably overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the cheese ball cone onto a serving plate to decorate. Lightly press some of the parsley
                into the cheese, then dot the pine nuts to create a string light effect. Decorate next with bell
                pepper pieces and pistachio nuts to resemble baubles or ornaments. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Press in the remaining parsley to fill in any gaps. Then, cut a star from a thick slice of cheese using a small
                cookie cutter. Attach it to the top of the tree with a toothpick to keep it secure. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with crackers, bread, or sturdy chips
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Nuts are Optional:</strong> You can make this a nut-free cheese ball. Add a few more pieces of yellow or red 
                pepper in place of them while decorating the tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Other Decorations:</strong> You can get creative with decorating your Christmas Tree Cheese Ball.
                Try adding sliced green olives, roasted red peppers, pieces of red onion, or even chopped bacon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Soften the Cream Cheese:</strong> Don't try to mix this up until your cream cheese has softened 
                to room temperature.
            </li>
        </ul>
