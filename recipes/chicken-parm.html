            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
            <li>
                Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
            </li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over the chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>
                Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. 
                Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides.
                Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to simmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. 
                The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil
                and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. an instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
